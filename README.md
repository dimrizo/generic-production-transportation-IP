# generic-production-transportation-IP
A simple Production and Transportation Problem solved in Lingo 19.0.

This is a generic problem that comes accross in Integer Programming courses. Given a problem description and the associated data, a model and a solution are derived.

Problem Description: A company called "ABC S.A." produces 3 products in 3 factories and supplys them to 3 different markets. Given the indices k e [1,3], i e [1,3] and j e [1,3], derive a mathematical model and derive a solution using Lingo software. Please consider the following data tables: 

Cost of production for a single unit of product k at factory i
 | k = 1 | k = 2 | k = 3 
--- | --- | --- | --- 
i = 1 | 3 | 5 | 5
i = 2 | 5 | 4 | 2
i = 3 | 4 | 6 | 5
